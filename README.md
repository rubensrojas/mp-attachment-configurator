# MP Attachment Finder Flow

The project involves creating a flow for customers to find a more suitable attachment for their current machine. 
Depending on the type of machine they use, they will receive different questions to help them select the best fit for their needs.

The code is designed to be agnostic to any specific type of attachment. You simply need to fetch the required data and flows, and it can be placed anywhere on the platform.
